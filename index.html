var quotes=['\"From birth, man carries the weight of gravity on his shoulders. He is bolted to earth. But man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free.\"',
'\"What a chance\, to get a better peek\. At the plants\, and creatures of the deep.\"',
'\"On such a full sea are we now afloat\, And we must take the current when it serves\, Or lose our ventures.\"',
'\"As for me\, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas\, and land on barbarous coasts.\‚Äù',
'\"Full fathom-five thy father lies\, of his bones are coral made. Those are pearls that were his eyes. Nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a sea-change\, into something rich & strange.\"',
'\"We would be warm below the storm\, in our little hideaway beneath the waves. Resting our head on the sea bed\, in an octopus\'s garden near a cave.\"',
'\"The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence. It is nothing but love and emotion; it is the Living Infinite.\"',
'\"Take me, and cast me forth in to the sea: so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.\"',
'\"When men come to like a sea-life, they are not fit to live on land.\"',
'\"And it\'s peaceful in the deep\; Cathedral where you cannot breathe\; No need to pray\, no need to speak, Now I am under all.\"',
'\"It was He who set the Two Seas rolling\, the one sweet and fresh\, the other salt and bitter\, and set a rampart between them\, an insurmountable barrier.\"',
'\"I must go down to the seas again\; for the call of the running tide\, is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied.\"',
'\"He loved the sea, though not blindly: it was the cynical, self-contemptuous love of a man for a mistress whom he distrusts profoundly but cannot do without.\"'
